                        In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first-ever Bitcoin by a note book in Helsinki, Netherlands. Then Ethereum that supports smart contract came out, and since then, Blockchain technology has gradually matured and The Blockchain ecology is also gradually developing and growing. All kinds of public chains have risen in succession with their own edge, but there are also problems within, such as efficiency and stability and security. As the basis of technical trust, Blockchain is very easy to serve as the foundation of the financial industry. However, due to the disadvantages of the public chain, Defi is also limited, such as the abnormal loss of Uniswap, and the difficulty of converting value among chains are the main reasons why we start Mensa Project, to solve all the problems. It's going to be a process, and we're going to implement it

                        MensaProtocol is a across-chain automatic token swap protocol. It is designed to be both easier to use and safer. Instead of an order book system, it will use the AMM model, with prices are automatically adjusted according to what people buy and sell in the exchange. In addition, MensaProtocol is optimized on the basis of traditional AMM algorithm, which will reduce the volatile losses of market makers, which is very friendly to liquidity providers. Meanwhile, MensaProtocol will also have lower gas rates, making trading more favorable.

                            MensaEarn will automatically divide the funds into higher earning trading contracts. You can regard this as a decentralized quantitative trading system. Moreover, the rewards from MensaEarn will include but not limited to COMP, SYN, etc., and all these benefits will be used to buy back the MensaToken.

                            The supply and price of the token are entirely determined by the community, with no caps or restrictions. At the same time, the FOMO financing incentive model is set. The team will only get 8% of total token based on the amount of token produced and conduct a 5-year linear lock. And in honor of Hayden Adams and Vitalik Buterin, we will share 0.5 and 1 percent of our 8 percent tokens with them, respectively.
