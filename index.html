                ><br />Mensa uses a full DAO approach for fundraising, and the
                program is automatically executed by the smart contracts.<br />When
                the capital pool reaches a certain amount , the contract will
                automatically turn on DAO+ mode.<br />After the DAO+ mode is
                over. The contract will count the total amount of
                MensaToken(MST) generated during the fundraising period, and it
                will generate 8% of the total amount at one time, and it will
                not be released directly, but will be released by a five-year
                linear pattern, and the contract will be closed permanently.
                After that, there will be no new token generation, the generated
                MensaToken(MST) will be all MensaToken(MST) in the whole
                network, carrying all the governance rights of Mensa Protocol.
                <br />The MST step exchange rules are as follows<br />There is
                no pre-set amount for tokens, but as the amount of capital
                exchanged increases, the exchange rate will decrease.<br />In
                the exchange process, multiple capital pools are placed, and the
                proportion goes from high to low, but the volume of the capital
                pool will go from low to high.<br />The exchange ratio of the
                1st floor pool is<strong> 1: 40,000</strong>; the volume of the
                capital pool is <strong>10</strong> ETH, totalling
                <strong>400,000</strong> MST.<br />The exchange ratio of the 2nd
                pool is <strong>1: 37,735</strong>; the volume of the capital
                pool is <strong>18</strong> ETH, totalling
                <strong>679,245</strong> MST.<br />The exchange ratio of the
                10th floor pool is <strong>1 : 23,675</strong>; the volume of
                the capital pool is <strong>82</strong> ETH, totalling
                <strong>1,942,426</strong> MST.<br />The exchange ratio of the
                20th floor pool is <strong>1 : 14,013</strong>; the volume of
                the capital pool is <strong>162</strong> ETH, totalling
                &nbsp;<strong>2,141,724</strong> MST.<br />The exchange ratio of
                the 30th floor pool is <strong>1 : 7,382</strong>, the volume of
                the capital pool is <strong>242</strong>ETH, and the total
                volume is <strong>54,124,388</strong> MST.<br />When the
                exchange reaches level 30, the contract will start DAO+ mode.<br />In
                DAO+ mode, there will be a 72H countdown system that will
                refresh if the exchange limit exceeds 0.5 ETH.<br />If the
                countdown goes to zero, that is, no single transaction greater
                than 0.5ETH for 72 hours, then the Dao+ will shut down and 5% of
                the total amount raised will be awarded to the last address that
                raised more than 1ETH.

            In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first-ever Bitcoin by a note
            book in Helsinki, Netherlands. Then Ethereum that supports smart
            contract came out, and since then, Blockchain technology has
            gradually matured and The Blockchain ecology is also gradually
            developing and growing. All kinds of public chains have risen in
            succession with their own edge, but there are also problems within,
            such as efficiency and stability and security. As the basis of
            technical trust, Blockchain is very easy to serve as the foundation
            of the financial industry. However, due to the disadvantages of the
            public chain, Defi is also limited, such as the abnormal loss of
            Uniswap, and the difficulty of converting value among chains are the
            main reasons why we start Mensa Project, to solve all the problems.
            It's going to be a process, and we're going to implement it

            <div class="one-desc">MensaSwap</div>
            <div class="font-desc">
              MensaSwap is an automatic token exchange protocol. It is designed
              to be more secure and easier to use. Instead of an Order book
              system, it will use the AMM model, with prices automatically
              adjusted according to what people buy and sell in the exchange.
              The traditional AMM model has the problem of impermanent loss,
              that is, users provide liquidity to the platform and there is a
              risk of loss, which is called impermanent loss. Due to the design
              mechanism of automated market makers (AMM), it is possible that
              the AMM platform will not automatically change prices without
              arbitrageurs when external prices change. In this case, the
              external arbitrageurs will profit from the price difference
              between the platform and the external exchanges. At the same time,
              the users who provided the platform with liquidity suffered. Once
              this happens, users have no incentive to participate because they
              would have expected a profit to participate, but have lost money
              because of the spread. As a result, they have lost money by
              providing liquidity on automated marketmakers' platforms where
              they could have made bigger profits through centralised exchanges.
              Therefore, MensaSwap optimises the algorithm based on traditional
              AMM, adjusts the price curve, and reduces the volatile losses of
              market makers, which is very friendly to liquidity providers.
              Meanwhile, MensaSwap will also have higher gas rates, making
              transactions more favourable. In future releases, we will
              implement the flow of value between different chains.

                MensaEarn is an open financial quantitative system. MensaEarn
                will automatically divide the existing funds into profitable
                contracts with higher returns. You can understand it as
                quantitative stock trading, but the overall is decentralised,
                and the use of MensaEarn reward will be gained by the user,
                including but not limited to COMP, SYN. Part of raised fund will
                be placed in MensaEarn ecological continues to generate profits,
                all this will be to interact with other open financial
                protocols. At the same time, MensaEarn will also provide more
                usage scenarios for the MST in later versions, we will explain
